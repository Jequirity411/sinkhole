1) Introduction

Sinkhole is a program designed to emulate existing services such
as dns, ftp, http, and irc. Its purpose is only to log relevant parts
of these protocols to aid administrators in analyzing network based
attacks. This sinkhole is capable of supporting multiple different
protocols at once, and allows virtual servers by grouping clients in
to classes based on IP.

2) Installation

Installing Sinkhole requires autoconf and can easily be done by
the standard:

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 # make install

Optionally you may use the configure options --prefix to choose the
install path, and --enable-debug to compile with debugging symbols.
Other command line options can be seen with ./configure --help.

3) Configuration

The default configuration file is installed in /etc from the base
dir given by --prefix, and is named sinkhole.conf.example. It should
be copied to sinkhole.conf and then edited to configure the sinkhole.

The configuration is structured in blocks, with blocks containing items
with values associated with them, or more blocks.

Each supported protocol and logging system is in the form of a module,
so they can be enabled and disabled at will.

See the example configuration for detailed examples of how this works.

4) P0f

This sinkhole also supports P0f, which is a passive OS fingerprinting tool
that is (C) 2000-2006 Michal Zalewski (lcamtuf@coredump.cx). Its webpage
is available at http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f.shtml.

P0f allows the sinkhole to get the operating system of connecting clients.
To enable P0f, load the p0f.so module in the config and then start the P0f
binary by issuing:

 $ sudo ./p0f -Q /var/run/p0f.sock -u `whoami`

This will start P0f listening on /var/run/p0f.sock (you may replace this with
whatever you wish). Next, add the path to the socket P0f is listening on to
the configuration file.
